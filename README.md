## Modern Era Aceptance Testing Framework for NodeJS

CodeceptJS is a new testing framework for end-to-end testing with WebDriver (or others). 
It abstracts browser interaction to simple steps which is written from a user perspective. 
A simple test that verifies that "Welcome" text is present on a main page of a site will look like:

```js
Feature('CodeceptJS demo');

Scenario('check Welcome page on site', (I) => {
  I.amOnPage('/');
  I.see('Welcome');
}
``` 

Codeception tests are:

* **Synchronous**. You don't need to care about callbacks, or promises, test scenarios are linear, your test should be to.
* Written from **user's perspecitve**. Every action is a method of `I`. That makes test easy to read, write and maintain even for non-tech persons.
* backend **API agnostic**. We don't know which WebDriver implementation is running this test. We can easily switch from WebDriverIO to Protractor or PhantomJS.

Codeception uses **Helper** modules to provide actions to `I` object. Currently CodeceptJS has two helpers:

* **WebDriverIO** - wrapper on top of Selenium bindings library [WebDriverIO](http://webdriver.io/)
* **FileSystem** - simple helper for testing filesystem.

And more to come...

## Why CodeceptJS?

CodeceptJS is a successor of [Codeception](http://codeception.com), a popoular full-stack testing framework for PHP.
With CodeceptJS your scenario-driven functional and acceptance tests will be as simple and clean as they can be. 
You don't need to worry about asynchronous nature of NodeJS or about various APIs of Selenium, PhantomJS, Protractor, etc, 
as CodeceptJS unifies them and makes them work as they were sycnhronous.

## Features

* Based on [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework.
* Designed for scenario driven acceptance testing in BDD-style
* Uses ES6 natively without transpiler.
* Selenium WebDriver integration using [webdriverio](http://webdriver.io).
* Smart locators: use names, labels, matching text, CSS or XPath to locate elements.
* Interactive debugging shell: pause test at any point and try different commands in a browser. 
* Easily create tests, pageobjects, stepobjects with CLI generators.

## Examples

```js
Feature('CodeceptJS Demonstration');

Scenario('test some forms', (I) => {
  I.amOnPage('http://simple-form-bootstrap.plataformatec.com.br/documentation');
  I.fillField('Email', 'hello@world.com');
  I.fillField('Password', '123456');
  I.checkOption('Active');
  I.checkOption('Male');  
  I.click('Create User');
  I.see('User is valid');
  I.dontSeeInCurrentUrl('/documentation');
});

```
